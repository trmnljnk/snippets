## vim

Remove all lines that contain alphabetic characters in Vim, you can use the global command with a regular expression that matches alphabetic characters. Here’s how you can do it: 

```vim
  :g/\a/d
```

•	: enters command-line mode.
•	g stands for “global,” applying the command to all matching lines.
•	/\a/ is a regular expression where \a matches any alphabetic character (equivalent to [A-Za-z]).
•	d is the delete command, which deletes the matching lines.


1.	Remove Lines with Only Whitespace (Indented Blank Lines):
If some “empty” lines contain spaces or tabs, use this command instead:

```vim
  :g/^$/d
```

2.	Remove Consecutive Empty Lines (Leave Only One Blank Line):
To compress multiple empty lines into a single blank line:

```vim
  :g/^\s*$/,/./-j
```

Search for a line starting with 201812 in Vim, you can use the following command:
  
```vim
/^201812
```

Add an character to every line.

```vim
  :% norm A,
```
