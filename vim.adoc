Remove all lines that contain alphabetic characters in Vim, you can use the global command with a regular expression that matches alphabetic characters. Here’s how you can do it: 

```vim
:g/\a/d
```

•	: enters command-line mode.
•	g stands for “global,” applying the command to all matching lines.
•	/\a/ is a regular expression where \a matches any alphabetic character (equivalent to [A-Za-z]).
•	d is the delete command, which deletes the matching lines.


1	Remove Lines with Only Whitespace (Indented Blank Lines):
If some “empty” lines contain spaces or tabs, use this command instead:

```vim
:g/^$/d
```

2	Remove Consecutive Empty Lines (Leave Only One Blank Line):
To compress multiple empty lines into a single blank line:

```vim
:g/^\s*$/,/./-j
```

Search for a line starting with 201812 in Vim, you can use the following command:
  
```vim
/^201812
```

Add an character to every line.

```vim
:% norm A,
```

Remove last character from every line.

```vim
:%s/.\{1}$//
```

To remove the quotes around the numbers in Vim, you can use the following command:

```vim
:%s/"\(\d\+\)"/\1/g
```

•	:%s means “search and replace in the whole file.”
•	"(\d\+)" matches quotes around one or more digits (\d\+ matches one or more digits).
•	\1 replaces the match with the first captured group (the number without the quotes).
•	/g applies the replacement globally on each line.

Delete all comma's from every line.

```vim
:%s/\,//g
```
