## vim

Remove all lines that contain alphabetic characters in Vim, you can use the global command with a regular expression that matches alphabetic characters. Here’s how you can do it: 

```vim
:g/\a/d
```

•	: enters command-line mode.
•	g stands for “global,” applying the command to all matching lines.
•	/\a/ is a regular expression where \a matches any alphabetic character (equivalent to [A-Za-z]).
•	d is the delete command, which deletes the matching lines.


1	Remove Lines with Only Whitespace (Indented Blank Lines):
If some “empty” lines contain spaces or tabs, use this command instead:

```vim
:g/^$/d
```

2	Remove Consecutive Empty Lines (Leave Only One Blank Line):
To compress multiple empty lines into a single blank line:

```vim
:g/^\s*$/,/./-j
```

Search for a line starting with 201812 in Vim, you can use the following command:
  
```vim
/^201812
```

Add an character to every line.

```vim
:% norm A,
```

Remove last character from every line.

```vim
:%s/.\{1}$//
```

To remove the quotes around the numbers in Vim, you can use the following command:

```vim
:%s/"\(\d\+\)"/\1/g
```

•	:%s means “search and replace in the whole file.”
•	"(\d\+)" matches quotes around one or more digits (\d\+ matches one or more digits).
•	\1 replaces the match with the first captured group (the number without the quotes).
•	/g applies the replacement globally on each line.


```vim
%s/"//g
```


Delete all comma's from every line.

```vim
:%s/\,//g
```

To replace every comma with a new line character in Vim, you can use the following command in Normal mode:

```vim
:%s/,/\r/g
```

•	:%s: This specifies that the substitution should happen on all lines in the file (% represents the entire file).
•	,: This is the character to search for.
•	\r: This represents a new line in Vim’s substitution.
•	g: This makes the substitution global, replacing all occurrences on each line.

Wrap each line in a text file with double quotes 

```vim
:%s/.*/"&"/
```
Explanation:
•	%: Apply the substitution (s) to all lines in the file.
•	.*: Matches the entire content of each line.
•	"&": Replaces the matched content with itself wrapped in double quotes (the & represents the matched content).
